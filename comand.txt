- [Instructor] The final component of agentic AI that we will discuss is memory. Memory plays a key role in agentic AI. It keeps track of the conversations and tasks happening in an agent. This provides context to the planner to plan the next steps. It also keeps the history of actions for future reference. There are typically two types of memory in agents, namely short-term memory, and long-term memory. Let's discuss short-term memory now. In general, the life of short-term memory is the execution of a single prompt or goal. It also can be a single chat session with a user with multiple goals. This provides context when calling the LLM for planning. It also gives the history of what has happened so the LLM can decide on the next action. It keeps track of history of the workflow being executed to achieve the goals. This can be LLM calls for planning and the LLM responses. It also contains all the tool calls and the results returned from the tools. Memory also contains the chat history when the agent serves as an assistant that is chatting with the user. Short-term memory is typically stored directly in the computer memory or in a distributed cache. It's transient. It'll get deleted after the goal or chat is over. It can also be transferred over to long-term memory. What is then long-term memory in an AI agent? First comes parameter memory. This is when a model is fine tuned for use with a specific agent. The modified parameters of the model are part of the agent's long-term memory. Vector databases used in RAG tools also serve as memory. This memory serves as a reference knowledge for the agent. Short-term memory that is tracked for a given goal or chat sessions will be archived as observations in long-term memory. This contains the user and assistant conversation history across multiple chat sessions. It'll also contain planning and tool use history over time. This is helpful for analytics as well as enables the agent to learn from experience if those capabilities are built in.
